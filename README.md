#complexity-comparaison-tests.

Hello *-*

Well the program gonna take you to the ##sorts world or to the Hanoi Tower world

At the end it will creat a csv file contains the arrays sizes and the complexity 

of each algorithm sort ,it'll show you too a graph (i used gnuplot /*open .gnu files with bin/gnuplot.exe */) ,

it will creat too a log file contains the original Array and after the 

sorts algorithms and the execution time of each algo 

##Install:

link to download GNUPlot --> https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/

Hope you'll enjoy readng it ;) have fun *thnk you*
